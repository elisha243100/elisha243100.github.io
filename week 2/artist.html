    <p>Laufey (pronounced Lay-vay), full name Laufey Lín Jónsdóttir, is an Icelandic-Chinese singer, songwriter, and
        multi-instrumentalist born on April 23, 1999, in Reykjavík, Iceland. Known for her smooth vocals and jazzy,
        nostalgic sound, she blends jazz, pop, and classical influences into a modern style often called “modern jazz
        pop.” She studied cello and voice at the Berklee College of Music before releasing her debut EP Typical of Me in
        2021. Her first album, Everything I Know About Love (2022), and her Grammy-winning follow-up Bewitched (2023),
        earned widespread acclaim. Laufey is celebrated for reviving interest in jazz among younger audiences with her
        heartfelt storytelling and vintage-inspired sound.
