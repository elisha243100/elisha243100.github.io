    <p>Katseye (stylized in all caps and pronounced “cat’s eye”) is a six-member international girl group based in Los
        Angeles.They function as a music artist collective under HYBE x Geffen Records, creating and performing original
        songs, albums, and music videos. Like other pop or K-pop groups, KATSEYE are considered a single artist entity
        even though they consist of multiple members. Formed in 2023 through The Debut: Dream Academy, a global
        competition by HYBE and Geffen Records, the
        group officially debuted on June 28, 2024, with their single “Debut.” They later released their first EP SIS
        (Soft Is Strong) in August 2024. Known for their diverse backgrounds, the members hail from the United States,
        South Korea, the Philippines, and Switzerland, reflecting Katseye’s identity as a global pop act. Their music
        blends pop and K-pop influences, paired with striking visuals and energetic performances. In 2025, they gained
        international recognition with their hit “Gnarly” from the EP Beautiful Chaos, which became their first song to
        chart on the Billboard Hot 100.
